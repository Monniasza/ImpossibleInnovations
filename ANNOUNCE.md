***Impossible Innovations V0.8.8.6 is on the wild!***

- - - 
* 2019-0728: 0.8.8.6 (Lisias) for KSP >= 1.3.1
	+ Using KSPe.Util.Image facilities
		- update to the most recent [KSPAPIExtensions](https://github.com/net-lisias-ksp/KSPAPIExtensions/releases) (2.1.0.15 at the present moment). 
	+ Binary certified to work fine from 1.4.1 to 1.7.3! #hurray
	+ Dependencies are not more embedded. We are sorry for the inconvenience, but it's unfeasible to keep various downloads to the same version when only the dependencies are KSP version locked.
		- See [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/net-lisias-ksp/ImpossibleInnovations/blob/master/INSTALL.md) for detailed instructions.
	+ Avoiding runtime problems on TweakScale
	+ Certified for use from KSP 1.3.1 to KSP 1.7.3

Now Impossible Innovations works from KSP 1.3.1 to the latest. Using the same package, no changes.

On the other hand, the dependencies are not being packed together anymore - there's no point on making the Add'On "multi KSP" just to be forced to distribute multiple packages due Add'On restrictions. Most of the time, the Add'Ons are utterly
