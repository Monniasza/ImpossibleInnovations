## Description

This add in is useful for providing some functions that make interacting with the KSP API functionally nicer and with an improved interface. 

### Sample Crafts

* ![](./PR_material/ImpossibleInnovations/crafts/II-R.jpg)
	+ Impossible Innovations/R
	+ Pretty standard multistage rocket:
		- Maximum Thrust / Engage SAS
		- Hit Stage to engage Deuterium Engines
		- Hit Stage to engage boosters and release clamps
		- Incline her to 5Â° as soon as she lift off - to prevent the boosters to falling over KSC.
* ![](./PR_material/ImpossibleInnovations/crafts/II-A_front.jpg)
	+ Impossible Innovations/A
	+ An Aeris 3A modified to use Ionized Wings and Deuterium rocket engine.
		- Engage the Tritium Fuel Cells before taking off, or the wings will not work properly!
