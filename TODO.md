# Impossible Innovations :: TODO list

* Fix parts that make the ship "jump" up about 900M on the sky
	+ Probable collision mesh problems
	+ parts:
		- Hydrogen Tank
		- Hydrogen Isotope Converter
* Revise the Hydrogen Intake to use the dynamic pressure too
	+ Huge amounts of electricity should be needed at rest.
* Parts balance:
	+ Revise the Deuterium and Tritium mass (too low!)
	+ Revise the Deuterium and Tritium ISP (too big!)
	+ Revise the Fuel Cell (weight, heat, power)
* The Large (4 crew) Pod is asymmetrical (see the windows), and the top needs to rotate 90Â° CW.
* New Parts:
	+ Fusion Jets!
	+ Inline Tritium Fuel Cell 
	+ Some fuel tanks for Aircrafts.
* Textures:
	+ For the Tritium Fuel Cell
* Tech Tree
	+ Correctly configure the techRequired tag on the parts!
